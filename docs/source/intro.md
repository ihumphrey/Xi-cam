# Xi-CAM

Xi-CAM is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that facilitates synchrotron data processing
and analysis. 

## Where to Start

### Developing Xi-CAM Plugins

Follow the installation instructions to set up Xi-CAM for development on your machine:

* [Linux Installation](install-linux.md)
* [macOS Installation](install-macos.md)
* [Windows Installation](install-windows.md)

Then, read the [GUI Plugin Guide](gui-plugin.md) to learn how to create a new GUI plugin
inside of Xi-CAM.

After creating a simple GUI plugin, see the [Operation Plugin Tutorial](operation-plugin.md)
to learn about operations and how to create one.

*Alternatively, for a quicker way to develop a plugin, you can read the [EZPlugin Guide](ez-plugin.md).
Although creating plugins with this is simpler, it is much more limited in how you can customize the plugin.*

The [Resources](resources.md) section has useful links to tutorials, examples, and documentation
that can help with developing Xi-cam plugins.
