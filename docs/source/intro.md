# Xi-cam

Xi-cam is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that facilitates synchrotron data processing
and analysis. 

## Where to Start

If you are interested in developing Xi-cam plugins, read through the
[Install Guide](install.md) to set up Xi-cam for development on your machine.

Then, read the [GUI Plugin Guide](gui-plugin.md) to learn how to create a template GUIPlugin and
how to extend its functionality. 
You can also read the [ProcessingPlugin Guide](processing-plugin.md) to learn more about developing
ProcessingPlugins, which are key to performing processes (operations, algorithms) on your data.

*Alternatively, for a quicker way to develop a plugin, you can read the [EZPlugin Guide].
Although creating plugins with this is simpler, it is much more limited in how you can customize the plugin.*

The [Resources](resources.md) section has useful links to tutorials, examples, and documentation
that can help with developing Xi-cam plugins.
